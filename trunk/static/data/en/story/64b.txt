[STORY]

LEONARD IN

LEONARD		Thanks! You know what else would really top off this design I'm working on? Some purple pincers. Maybe you've seen them before--they're also used for making poison.

LEONARD		I'd be much obliged if you can get me five {$BLUE Purple Pincers}. You can get them from {$RED Crabaos} and {$RED Yaras} down on the beach. {ACCEPT}  #specify with tobi

LEONARD OUT
