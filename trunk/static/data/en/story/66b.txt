SANDMAN IN

SANDMAN		Thank Poseidon you're here! My new house keeps getting wrecked by some kind of sea mammoth.

PLAYER		I think it's one of the Celestial Gatekeepers I'm trying to catch. Is it still around?

SANDMAN		I haven't seen it for a few days but as long as it's on the loose, my house is in peril--not to mention all my baby krill it keeps eating!

SANDMAN		As an airbreather, you'll have a heck of a time catching that fish on your own. Go to {$GREEN Sitnalta Plaza} and poke around--eventually you'll find a giant fishing hook. You'll need that to reel your prey in. {ACCEPT}
