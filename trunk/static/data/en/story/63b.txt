[STORY]

RICKY IN

RICKY			Whoah, hey, look everyone--it's the tamer who beat the sultan! Can I get your signature?

PLAYER		Can you help me with something?

RICKY			Sure, anything! You're kind of a huge deal around here--no one's ever beaten the sultan before. 

PLAYER		I'm trying to help a former thief return to Pueblonia. 

RICKY			Your name carries a lot of weight around here, so I'm pretty sure we can work it out. Who's this former thief?

PLAYER		Jezabelle.

RICKY			HER! No way. Nooooo way. Not cool.

RICKY			Well...maybe for you. I'll talk to the other shopkeepers. If you help clean up the vermin in these streets, that would definitely help your case. #beat a bunch of mogas between 62 and 70.

PLAYER		Thanks. {ACCEPT}
