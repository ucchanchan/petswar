[STORY]

	PIERCE		Whoa! Hold it, shortpants-- it's too dangerous out here to be a-traipsin' through the woods. Ever since that earthquake, the Mogas are all riled up.

	PLAYER		I know. I'm a tamer.

	PIERCE		Ain't much of one, from the looks of it. But, hey, if you can handle what the forest throws at you, maybe we can toughen you up into a REAL fighter someday.

	PIERCE		My company could use some help from a qualified tamer, but you just ain't ready yet.

	PLAYER		Your company?

	PIERCE		Never mind who I work for, shortpants. Just keep in mind that we have a vested interest in keeping these roads safe, and we reward our people well.

	PIERCE		But before I throw you any work, I gotta know that you can handle it. How about you prove yourself by icing five Trolos?

	PIERCE		Trolos are mean little cusses. They live all around here-- anywhere between Misasma Depths and Darkwood Vault-- but they're elusive. Might gotta hunt a little.

	PLAYER		I'll look for them.

	PIERCE		You do that, kid. Come back and see me when you've dropped five Trolos. We'll kick some butt, you and me. {OK}

	PIERCE OUT
