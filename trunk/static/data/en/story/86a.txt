[STORY]

PATTY_TOBI IN

PATTY_TOBI	Howdy, tamer-- I've got a little job for you. There's a strange rainbow that ends at {$GREEN Darkwood}. No matter what the weather's like, that rainbow stays fixed in the same spot. Pretty weird.
 
PATTY_TOBI	What do I think's going on? Well, it sounds silly, but there's a story that says the forest Mogas throw a party each spring, and they use a rainbow to show their friends where it is. But that can't be true, can it? 

PATTY_TOBI	Anyway, I'd love to know what's going on with that rainbow. And if there's a party, all the better! Think you can check it out? {ACCEPT}
