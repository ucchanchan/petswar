[STORY]

	SKYLAR IN

	PLAYER		You...!

	SKYLAR		Huh, what's this?  Is that you?  Oh, but it can't be-- you're too far from home! You know it's dangerous to go wandering around unless you're a Moga tamer...

	PLAYER		I am.

	SKYLAR		Eh? EHH!? Is that a Moga?! You're a tamer?! NO!

	SKYLAR		Whatever. I've been taming Mogas since last year. I'm gonna be a Moga Ranger in no time. My mom always said I should be more like you, but now you're following in my footsteps.

	SKYLAR		Ironic, huh? Don't count on catching up to me, though. I'm light years ahead of you and getting constantly more awesome. I'll be a Moga Master any day now.

	SKYLAR		You wanna try me?

	SKYLAR		...nah, just kidding! I'd kick your butt! I wouldn't want to embarrass your poor Mogas by exposing what a terrible trainer you are. Maybe later!

	SKYLAR		Look, past this bridge is Windhym. I heard the mayor there is looking for a tamer for some dangerous mission. Naturally I'll be volunteering, but I should warn you: don't think you're hot stuff just cause you have a coupla Mogas.

	SKYLAR		It's way nasty out there. You really should scamper on home before you get hurt. I certainly wouldn't respect you any less, HRRORORO!
	
	PLAYER		Argh... Skylar... 

	PLAYER		He's the worst guy. {OK}

	SKYLAR OUT
