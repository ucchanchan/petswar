SKYLAR IN

SKYLAR        What do YOU want, scrub? Come to grovel for a Cortex pass?

PLAYER        No, Skylar. I need to find the Gemini Celestial Gatekeeper, and I think you might know where it is.

SKYLAR        So, you've come begging for my help! How truly, delightfully pathetic. Well, guess what: go suck a lemon!

PLAYER        Skylar, I really need--

SKYLAR        Oh, and one more thing: Weetar here just let our a genuine RASCAL of a toot. It'll be coming your way in about... five seconds. Peace!

PLAYER        Argh... Skylar!

SKYLAR OUT

PIERCE IN

PIERCE        So, Skylar gave you the ol' brush-off, did he? Well, I kind of expected it. He's... he's the worst guy.

PLAYER        Yeah. I can't get to him through that force field.

PIERCE        Use your head, kid. The forcefield doesn't matter. There's a surefire way to get to a little brat like that: through his mommy.

PLAYER        I've met his mom. She's a little weird.

PIERCE        Pay her a little visit. Oldest trick in the book. You get to the mom, you get to the nerd. Bet you can find her at {$GREEN West Summer Road}.

PIERCE				What's that smell? Dang, Ranger, lay off the cabbage. {ACCEPT} #go to Skylar's mom at one of the first nodes
