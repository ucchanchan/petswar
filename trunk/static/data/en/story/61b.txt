[STORY]

POE IN

POE			Wow, it's so lightless...so putrid...I feel shadows creeping over me, and happiness fleeing my touch. Thank you so much.

POE			Now I remember--I had seen something strange lurking around {$GREEN Cyclonia Castle}. Even the powerful Mogas that live up there steered clear of it, but it never attacked me.

POE			I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but if you want to see it, bring a team of {$GOLD Sagittarius} Mogas--I've only seen it when those were around me. {ACCEPT}

POE OUT
