[STORY]

RICKY IN

RICKY		Greetings, stranger! Is this your first your time in Pueblonia?

PLAYER			Yeah, I came from the other side of Poseidon's Gorge.

RICKY		Boy howdy are you in for a treat! Did you know that Pueblonia is the most rectangular city in the world?

RICKY		 We also have the most diseased vermin! I could go on all day listing Pueblonia's superlatives.

RICKY		One thing you definitely need to know: our child sultan is crazy about Moga taming. I mean, this kid has Mogas coming out his ears. Tough ones, too.

RICKY		To even challenge the sultan you'd have to defeat his guards at the {$GREEN Parapets of Dawn} and {$GREEN Prince's Perch}. Plus, rumor has it that he's controlled by his cruel adviser, Kareem Abdul. 

RICKY		But you wouldn't be crazy enough to fight the sultan when you could just leave peacefully, so I don't know why I'm telling you this. Take it easy!

NOVA IN

NOVA		This kid is giving Moga tamers a bad name. You need to teach him a lesson in humility. 

NOVA		To get to the sultan, you'll need to go through his guards. The first one's at the {$GREEN Parapets of Dawn}. Good luck! {ACCEPT}
