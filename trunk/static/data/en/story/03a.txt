[STORY]

	MIA		Lia!? Oh! Sorry, I thought you were my sister. I keep hoping she'll make it back...

	PLAYER		Is your sister missing?
		
	MIA		She disappeared with our pet Momo a week ago. She always talked about going out to sea for a great adventure, but I didn't think she'd leave so soon...

	MIA		But now the lighthouse lamp has gone out! Normally Lia would take Momo to Swirly Beach and catch a wild Twister-- they carry glowing gems called starlights that we use to keep the lamp on.
	
	PLAYER		Maybe I could find a starlight for you.

	MIA		Oh, would you? I have to light the lamp so the ships will be safe... and if Lia sees the light, she'll know that everything is OK.

	PLAYER		I'll see what I can do.

	MIA		Thank you so much! Twisters usually live to the east, between Sandswirl Shrubwalk and Sandswirl Tidal Pool. You may have to fight a few before you find one that's carrying a starlight. {ACCEPT}
