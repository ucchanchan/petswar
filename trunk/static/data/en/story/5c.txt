	PLAYER		...

	SHEEP_GUY	Baaaaaah!  I was pretty wild in my youth... we've all made some mistakes!

	PLAYER		These look pretty recent...

	SHEEP_GUY	I've turned a corner! I'm going legit, I swear!

	SHEEP_GUY	Anyway, thanks for getting the photos. But don't tell anyone... did you know a flock of sheep can skeletonize a man in six minutes? Think about it. {OK}
