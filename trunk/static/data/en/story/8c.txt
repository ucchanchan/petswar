[STORY]

	FREDRIC		Ah, how invigorating! It's been so long since I've battled a worthy foe. The last time must've been... before I died.

	FREDRIC		I hope I didn't alarm you. My soul has been restless for ages, waiting for a worthy tamer to find the key to the gates. I died holding it... Did you find my body there as well?

	PLAYER		YOUR body?  Then that skeleton with the key was... you?

	FREDRIC		It was. But now... on to greater aventure. Having tasted battle once more, I feel I can finally be at peace. Thank you.

	FREDRIC		Please take any treasures you find here. My kingdom has no need of them anymore. {OK}

	FREDRIC OUT
