[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA		I think you'll be excited to catch this next Moga--it's one of the natural wonders of the woods.

NOVA		 It's called a Peascorp. You can probably figure out why. Catching this ornate beauty at {$GREEN Darkwood} will get you one step closer to mastering the art of Moga taming. {ACCEPT}
