[STORY]
		
	NOVA		Nice work-- looks like you found Beefee! But that's just the first step.
	
	NOVA		Some people use the gift of taming just to help themselves, but a Moga Ranger uses their powers to make the world better. If you want to be a Ranger, you need to help people in need.

	NOVA		I spotted a guy over in {$GREEN Summer Field} who looked like he could use assistance. It's just down the road from here. You should see if you can use your Mogas to help him out.

	NOVA		But before you head there, your Mogas need you to head home. It may be tempting to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you need to slow down and heal your team up.
	
	NOVA		The Sky Cat Taxi will take you home now so you can let your Mogas rest and heal, get help from your friends and harvest Whistle Fruits for free bonus attacks. {OK}
	
	NOVA OUT
