[STORY]
		
NOVA		Something's got the Mogas spooked. I don't know; maybe you can feel it, too. I just can't shake the feeling that something big is on the way. 

NOVA		Well, I didn't come here just to freak you out--I've got useful information. Since they're on edge, it'll be easier to capture ----- right now. Catching them might come in handy later on. {OK}
