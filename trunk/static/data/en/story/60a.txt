[STORY]

PIERRE IN	

PLAYER		Pierre, I need your help. I heard you might know where the Taurus Celestial Gatekeeper is.

PIERRE		Maybe I do. But since I'm the greatest tamer in the land, it should be ME who tames it!

PLAYER		But didn't I beat you?

PIERRE    So!?

KAREEM 		Now, Pierre. I think you know what he means. You'd better be a good sport and help him find the Celestial Gatekeeper.

PIERRE		Gosh dang it! That Moga should be MINE! I'm a Taurus! I'm the greatest!

KAREEM		Pierre! Do we need a time out?

PIERRE		Fine! I'll tell you where it is... if you find me a MOGANAME! It's the last Moga I need for my perfect team... if I had one, I could beat you any day.

KAREEM		It sounds fair to me. You can find these Mogas between {$GREEN } and {$GREEN }. What do you say, Ranger?

PLAYER		OK. I'll tame a MOGANAME for you.

PIERRE		Yesssssss! I'm gonna kick your butt once I have it!

KAREEM	Pierre! Enough! {ACCEPT}

PIERRE OUT

KAREEM OUT
