[STORY]

PIERCE IN

PIERCE		I'm mighty appreciative for your help up here, tamer. While you were tangling with those rascals I was able to poke around these islands. Make sure there weren't any surprises waiting for you.

PIERCE		I'm happy to say, this place is safe as milk. Definitely no star fragments with mysterious powers. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my employers--they're waiting for my report. Later 'gator! {OK}

PIERCE OUT
