PIERCE IN

PIERCE        You found it, eh? I knew you would. Nice job, kid.

PIERCE        Now, I've got some good news and some bad news for you. Good news is that I've figured out who to ask about the next Celestial Gatekeeper.

PIERCE        The bad news? Well, it seems logical that you'd have to talk to a powerful tamer-- and the only one left in these parts is that doofus, Skylar.

PIERCE        I disliked him from the moment I met him, but if you can suffer through another conversation with him, he might have some useful info.

PIERCE        Head out to {$GREEN Cortex} and pay him a visit, kid. {ACCEPT}
