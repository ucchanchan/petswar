[STORY]
		
	JACKFROST		I can't believe it! You've tamed a Lainedeer!
	
	JACKFROST		In all my centuries of wintermaking, I've never seen one in the hands of a tamer. Perhaps you're destined to be a great Master.
	
	JACKFROST		But now it's back to work for me, tamer. Look for me again next winter, when the first snow begins to fall-- I'll be expecting you!
	
	JACKFROST OUT
