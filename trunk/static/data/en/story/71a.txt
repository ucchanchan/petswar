[STORY]

NEWYEAR_TOBI IN
NEWYEAR_TOBI        Oh, tamer! Thank goodness you're here! Those rascally Lepus are running wild!

NEWYEAR_TOBI        Every dozen years or so, our Lunar New Year Festival seems to bring them a-hopping out of the woodwork... something about the strange forces of the moon, I suppose.

NEWYEAR_TOBI        Rabbits have been brutally annoying the Sky Cats for generations. They're our greatest natural enemy! Don't ask why-- it's just the order of the universe.

NEWYEAR_TOBI        Plus, I'm aller-- AH-CHOO! --allergic to them. Do you think you could help us get the Lepus under control?

LEPUS        #anim of rabbit you hunt

NEWYEAR_TOBI        You'll find them scurrying all over the place. If you captured one, you might better understand their strengths and weaknesses. {ACCEPT}
