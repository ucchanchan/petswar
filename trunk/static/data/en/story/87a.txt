[STORY]

TOBI IN

TOBI	Howdy tamer! I just wanted to let you know, the volleyball team at Sky Cat High School is trying to raise money for a big tournament by doing odd jobs around Sunshire.

TOBI	For a limited time, you'll be able to get them to harvest all the whistlefruit at friends' homes for only five Star Coins--half the usual price. It's a great deal, and it's for a good cause! 

TOBI	To hire them, just head home and click on the cat in overalls hanging out in your yard!
