[STORY]

	PLAYER		What do you need me to do?

	PIERCE		I might need you to do a little scouting. I'm holding down the fort out here, but there's only one of me.
	
	PIERCE		I want you to check something out. I've only met one other tamer out here, and I'm not sure he was worth his salt. Had some skills, but no character. Real shady type.

	PIERCE		You should go look for him. I've seen him skulking around to the northeast, right by the bridge. See if he's legit-- if not, keep an eye on him.

	PLAYER		I'll pay him a visit.

	PIERCE		See that you do, kid. {OK}

	PIERCE OUT
