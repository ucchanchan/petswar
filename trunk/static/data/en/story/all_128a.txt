[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA		The Wasabees around here are stronger than Lambo and Dinho. Not too strong, though--I think it will be a good challenge for you, and one with a nice reward.

WASABEE		

NOVA		With a {$RED Wasabee} in your collection, you should have enough Mogas to make two teams. That will let you keep moving even when some Mogas are tired. You can find them at {$GREEN Warmwood Trail}. {ACCEPT}
