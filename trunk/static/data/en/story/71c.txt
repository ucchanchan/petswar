[STORY]

NEWYEAR_TOBI IN

NEWYEAR_TOBI		If we really want to make headway against the rabbity horde, we can't just go after the foot soldiers--we need to think bigger!

NEWYEAR_TOBI		If you capture a War Lepus, their whole strategy will be thrown into disarray. They're tough to find, but capturing one means disrupting the operations of a hundred more.

NEWYEAR_TOBI		You'll know them when you see them. I have a photo from the Sky Cat Intelligence Archives:

WAR_LEPUS		#[image - War Lepus]

NEWYEAR_TOBI		Good luck, tamer!
