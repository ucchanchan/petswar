[STORY]

SANDMAN IN

PLAYER				I'm afraid I don't understand.

SANDMAN		You're here to steal my family's heirlooms, aren't you? 

PLAYER				I'm not here to rob you. I'm just trying to get to Cortex.

SANDMAN		Thank Poseidon! If you're not a foe, perhaps you can help my long-suffering civilization.

SANDMAN		Since our sea began drying up, the once-submerged city of Sitnalta has been ruined, and land-beasts have been stealing our artifacts to build dams.

SANDMAN		I must recover my family's precious treasures so we can move into a new ocean home, but the desert heat will boil me into a delicious bisque!

SANDMAN		My family's jewel collection is the most valuable of our lost treasures. 

JEWELS

SANDMAN		Will you lend me a claw and retrieve them? You'll find my {$BLUE jewels} between the {$GREEN Portal o' Ruins} and {$GREEN Sitnalta Field}. {ACCEPT}

SANDMAN OUT
