[STORY]

SKYLAR IN

SKYLAR        What? YOU? Don't you know it's dangerous to go wandering around unless you're an awesome Moga tamer like me?! Run home to mama!

PLAYER        I'm a Moga tamer too.

SKYLAR        Eh? EHH!? Is that a Moga?! You're a tamer?! NO!

SKYLAR        Whatever. I've been taming Mogas since last year. I'm gonna be a Moga Ranger in no time. My mom always said I should be more like you, but now you're following in MY footsteps.

SKYLAR        Ironic, huh? Don't count on catching up to me, though. I'm lightyears ahead of you and getting constantly more awesome. I'll be a Moga Master any day now.

SKYLAR        So, I guess you want to get across this bridge, huh? Well, it's your UNlucky day, 'cause I'm not letting you through without a fight! {ACCEPT}
