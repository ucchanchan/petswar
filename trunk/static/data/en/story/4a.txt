[STORY]

	KELEKA		Ho! Aren't you a little small to be a Moga tamer? I need some help in a mighty bad way, but you gotta be TOUGH!

	PLAYER		What do you need help with?

	KELEKA		Ever since the lighthouse went out, ships have been crashing on the reef. Sharks have been feasting on the sailors in the water! Oh, it's terrible!

	KELEKA		I've been using a poison from purple crab pincers to stun the sharks. The problem is, I've run out of purple pincers-- can you help me find more?

	PLAYER		I'll do my best.

	KELEKA		You may be skinny, child, but you've got GUTS! There are Crabaos crawling all over this beach-- hunt them to find the pincers! {ACCEPT}

	KELEKA OUT
