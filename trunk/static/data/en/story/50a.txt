[STORY]

JEZABELLE IN

JEZABELLE		You don't look like you're from around these parts.

PLAYER					No, I came from Windhym.

JEZABELLE		Oh good! Maybe you'll be able to help me--none of the tamers around here are strong enough.

JEZABELLE		You see, I'm really a princess. A wild Moga ran off with my purse. It had all my money and royal ID card, and now I can't get back into the palace. 

JEZABELLE		Will you please get it for me? I think it's just up the trail at the {$GREEN Sandsink}. {ACCEPT}

JEZABELLE OUT
