[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA    Looks like you've gotten a lot stronger since I first saw you--good job. I'd like to see how your Mogas are progressing with a little sparring.

NOVA		When Moga tamers meet they'll often test each other with a Moga battle. Sometimes it's just for fun, like this. Other times it's deadly serious. 

NOVA		When you fight other trainers they'll have several Mogas on their team, just like you do. See if you can use a little strategy to beat me! {ACCEPT}

NOVA OUT
