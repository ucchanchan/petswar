PIERCE IN

PIERCE        Hey, kid. Remember your old buddy, Pierce?

PIERCE        I think I know what you've been up to. Looks to me like you're sniffing around for the Celestial Guardians. Coming pretty close to a full set.

PIERCE        Since we're pals and all, maybe I should help you out. I think I know where you can find one.

PLAYER        I don't know, Pierce... what are you going to ask in return?

PIERCE        Nothing, kid. I still want you to work with me, but let's just put that aside for now.

PIERCE        I help you, maybe you'll return the favor someday, right? No pressure, though. This is just a favor for a friend.

PIERCE        When I was posted in the forest outside Sunshire, at {$GREEN Darkwood Vault}, I kept catching glimpses of a strange Moga--I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.

PIERCE        But in hindsight, I'd bet anything it's just the critter you're after. If you bring the right team out there--maybe all {$GOLD Gemini}?--I'm guessing it'll show itself.

PIERCE        Good luck, kid. I'm sure I'll be seeing you again real soon. {ACCEPT}
