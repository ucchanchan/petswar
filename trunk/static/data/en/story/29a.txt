[STORY]
		
	NOVA		Looks like you're ready to head into the woods. I saw a soldier stationed out there, dressed all in black-- you should go find him and see if he needs any help.
	
	NOVA		It's important to keep helping people whenever you can. That's really what being a Moga Ranger is all about. {OK}
	
	NOVA OUT
