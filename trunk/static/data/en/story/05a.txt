[STORY]

	SHEEP_GUY	We're sorry! BAAAAhh... Please don't steal our wool!

	PLAYER		Don't worry, I'm not here to take your wool.

	SHEEP_GUY	Thank heavens! I'm just so nervous lately, but... a tamer like you probaaahbly doesn't have time to listen to my woeful bleatings.

	PLAYER		Something wrong?

	SHEEP_GUY	BAAAaahh. A few weeks ago, the local Woolfs came by and told me they have... compromising photos of me. They've been threatening to publish the photos unless we give them our wool.

	SHEEP_GUY	The Woolfs gather near the cave, back toward the woods. Will you please get those photos? I beg of you! BAaAAaAAAH! {ACCEPT}

	SHEEP_GUY OUT
