[STORY]

RICKY IN

RICKY		Wow, you're really as powerful as they say. We've been fighting those Mogas for months and getting nowhere!

PLAYER	So can Jezabelle return to the bazaar?

RICKY		I wish I had better news, but, no. It's like trying to get a cobra into a mongoose den--not gonna happen. 

JEZABELLE IN		

JEZABELLE		You jerks! I'm trying to make amends. This is why I started stealing in the first place--you're just so full of yourselves!

JEZABELLE		Well guess what? I just yoinked your wallet. Later!

JEZABELLE OUT

RICKY		Yeah, she's definitely not getting back in here. {OK}

RICKY OUT # tobi tells you to go see her again at rogue's rendezvous
