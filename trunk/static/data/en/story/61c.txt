[STORY]


POE IN

POE				That is quite a glorious creature you've captured. It would be perfect if it didn't have the stars--if the empty blackness of space swallowed everything. 

PLAYER		Thanks for helping me find it. Have you thought about the other thing I asked you? Can you help the prince of Pueblonia with poetry?  

POE				I would love to infect a young mind with the curse of poetry, but I'd be really out of place in Pueblonia. At least here I'm surrounded by people like me. 

PLAYER		You live in a graveyard.

POE				Exactly. Actually... I do know someone who lives outside of Pueblonia, in a place called {$GREEN Sandshitre}. I've seen some of her work in my favorite poetry zine, "Night Terrors." Could you introduce us?

PLAYER		Sure--and thanks for helping me find that Celestial Gatekeeper. 

POE			No problem. Now if you'll excuse me, I have an epic to work on. It's about ants eating my body after I'm dead. {ACCEPT}
