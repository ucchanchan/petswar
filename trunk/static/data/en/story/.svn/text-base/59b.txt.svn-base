[STORY]

CRAIG IN

# some kind of team battle with aggressive water mogas.

CRAIG		Whoah, looks like you got a little roughed up, mate! I should've mentioned: the Watersquirrel mating meet-up is also a freeding frenzy for [whatever Mogas you fight].

CRAIG		Just a beautiful spectacle of nature, isn't it?! Makes my skin tingle! Wow!

CRAIG		But back to the reason you're here--you're looking for the Celestial Gatekeepers. 

CRAIG		Kick around in the Rude Dunes with a team of {$GOLD Aries}. With any luck, you'll run into one of thos magnificent Gatekeepers!
