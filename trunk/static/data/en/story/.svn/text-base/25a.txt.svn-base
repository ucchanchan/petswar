[STORY]

	LYLE IN

	PLAYER		Lyle? Is that you?
		
	LYLE		Hey, neighbor! You got a minute? I'm in big trouble!

	PLAYER		So you're the guy Nova was talking about...

	LYLE		Who? Anyway, here's how it is: I bought some chocolates for my long-distance girlfriend, Gertrude...
	
	SEXY_GF
	
	LYLE		What? Why are you looking at me like that? She loves me for my personality, OK!?!
	
	LYLE		Anywho, she lives in Windhym, and I think the earthquakes wrecked it up pretty good. I was making her a care package, but these big angry bee things came and stole the chocolates!

	LYLE		Those chocolates were the cornerstone of the whole care package operation! I tried to get them back, but they beat the gravy out of me and stung me in the face!
	
	PLAYER		I'm a Moga tamer now. Do you need some help?
	
	LYLE		Well, if you're offering... yeah! I need you to grab those chocolates from the bees. I think they're called Wasabees. They hang around back up the road, on the Warmwood Trail.
	
	WASABEE

	PLAYER		OK, I'll have a look.
	
	LYLE		Hurry up, pal! The chocolates are gonna melt! {ACCEPT}
	
	LYLE OUT
