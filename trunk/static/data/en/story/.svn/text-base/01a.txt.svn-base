[STORY]

	LYLE		Done! Gertrude's care package is ready for delivery...  but I'm not a Moga tamer like you, so I'll never make it to Windhym.

	LYLE		What do you say? Do me one more solid? If you run the package to Windhym for me, I'll, uhh... clean up my yard. I know you think it's unsightly or whatever.

	DISHES

	PLAYER		...

	PLAYER		Whatever.  OK.

	LYLE		Thanks...  you're the best neighbor ever!

	PLAYER		I wish I could say the same... {ACCEPT}

	LYLE OUT
