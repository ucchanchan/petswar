[STORY]

SKYLAR IN

SKYLAR    So, the bigshot Moga Ranger made it aaaaaall the way to Cortex, huh?

PLAYER    Skylar!

SKYLAR    Bad news, chump: they're only letting ONE tamer through the force field. And they've already picked their pony! ME! I'm the pony!

SKYLAR    C'mon, Weetar! Let's leave this chump in the DUST! 

SKYLAR OUT

SKYLAR IN

SKYLAR    Oh, I almost forgot to tell you: toodles, fartface!

SKYLAR OUT

PLAYER    Skylar... The WORST guy!

LYLA IN

LYLA    Hello there, visitor. Do you have a Cortex entry pass?

PLAYER    I've been sent here on urgent business from Windhym. 

LYLA    The official Windhym representative has already arrived. A young tamer named Skylar. He indicated that additional passes would not be required.

PLAYER    Skylar!

LYLA    I'm terribly sorry. If you'd like, I can submit a request for an additional entry pass, but it may take some time to process.

PLAYER    But--

LYLA    Good day. {OK}

LYLA OUT
