[STORY]

SANDMAN IN

SANDMAN		There's one more thing I need to return to the sea: a giant pot we use to cook a special Sandschild family stew. 

SOUP		# soup pot anim

SANDMAN		Our legends tell of a stew so hearty that it would give my people the strength to destroy any foe--even the vile chief of the Electrotter tribe!

SANDMAN		But some Mogas have scurried off with the pot. They wander the desert, using it is as a mobile home. 

SANDMAN 	Look for them between {$GREEN Sitnalta Plaza} and the {$GREEN Biting Coast} and eventually you'll find them. {ACCEPT}
