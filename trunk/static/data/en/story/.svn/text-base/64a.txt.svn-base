[STORY]

LEONARD IN

LEONARD			Back so soon! I saw your thief friend--so far she's behaving herself. Or maybe she just hasn't been caught yet.

PLAYER			I've run out of leads for finding Celestial Gatekeepers. Any ideas? 

LEONARD			Sorry, haven't heard anything. If you've got the time, though, could you do me a favor? 

LEONARD			One of my hobbies is making dreamcatchers and I can always use more feathers. If you could knock out ten {$RED Muninns} and get me their feathers I'd really appreciate it. {ACCEPT}

LEONARD OUT
