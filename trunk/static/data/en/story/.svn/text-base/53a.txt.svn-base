[STORY]

SCIENTISTS IN

SCIENTISTS		Oh, hello stranger. What brings you here? We don't get a lot of visitors.

PLAYER				I'm on my way to Cortex. I heard they have a way to stop the earthquakes.

SCIENTISTS		We're from Cortex. And yes, one of our research clusters does have a promising solution. 

SCIENTISTS		Not us, though. No, we got a real peach of an assignment--sent down here to study the giant petrfied dragon leavings.

PLAYER			Leavings?

SCIENTISTS		Don't make me spell it out, kid. Dung. Doo-doo. Poop.

SCIENTISTS		We think the earthquakes are being caused by a dragon deep underground. We're trying to learn what we can about it by studying these deposits. 

PLAYER				So the earthquakes are caused by a dragon? How can we stop it?

SCIENTISTS		Bad news, tamer: we haven't made much headway in that department. Frankly, things look pretty bad. Our plan is to launch Cortex into space when this planet starts coming apart. 

SCIENTISTS		It would take a miracle to find the dragon, let alone stop it. We're just hoping for enough time to escape.

SCIENTISTS		In the mean time, think you could get us some candy bars from the markets of Pueblonia? We're not allowed to leave the site without orders from Cortex and we're so bored of eating canned beans.

CANDYBAR

PLAYER			Will you tell me more about the dragon?

SCIENTISTS		Sure, that sounds fair.  {ACCEPT}
