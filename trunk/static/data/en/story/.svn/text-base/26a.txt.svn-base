[STORY]

	NOVA		Well, he certainly looked happy. And... sweaty. Did you find what he was after?
	
	PLAYER		Yeah, he just needed me to beat some Wasabees. They stole his girlfriend's chocolates.

	NOVA		I'm impressed-- that guy never would have found those chocolates if you hadn't helped. Sure, it's not saving the world, but you had to start somewhere.
	
	NOVA		I really think you've got what it takes to be a Moga Ranger. From here, it's all about building a great team and powering it up.

	NOVA		Things will get more and more dangerous as you head further into the wilderness. At the brink of the forest, there's a Moga called Owlreed... and he's not to be trifled with.

	NOVA		Before you head into the woods, I need to know that you can handle Owlreed. I'm guessing you'll need to get your Mogas up to level 5 or so before you can get past him.

	PLAYER		How do I do that?

	NOVA		You can always retrace your steps to places you've already explored and fight the Mogas there-- you'll gain experience, get chances to capture Mogas and maybe even find some useful items.

	NOVA		I'll find you again when you've beaten Owlreed. Good luck out there! {OK}

	NOVA OUT
