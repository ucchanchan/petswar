[STORY]

	LYLE IN

	PLAYER		Hey, Lyle.
		
	LYLE		Hey, neighbor!  The big earthquake last night wrecked Windhym pretty good.  I made a care package to send there for my long-distance girlfriend, Gertrude...
	
	SEXY_GF
	
	LYLE		What?  Why are you looking at me like that!?  What can I say... she loves my personality, OK?!
	
	LYLE		Anyway, I tried to go to Windhym myself, but the wild Mogas are all going crazy. {$RED Wasabees} jumped me and took Gertrude's chocolates.  Ow, I'm still sore.

	LYLE		Whoa, you're a Moga tamer now?  Awesome! You can beat up the Wasabees and get the chocolates back! Right!?
	
	PLAYER		Hmm...
	
	LYLE		C'mon, you saw her picture.  I'll never get another chance like this.
	
	PLAYER		OK, OK.
	
	LYLE		You can usually find Wasabees on the road between our place and the forest.  They're those green bee-lookin' things that are always hanging around.
	
	WASABEE
	
	PLAYER		I'll do my best. {ACCEPT}
	
	LYLE OUT
