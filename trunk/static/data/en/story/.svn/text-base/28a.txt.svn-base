[STORY]
		
	LYLE		Aww, snap! Thank goodness it's you, neighbor. I just got my face rocked by these spazzed-out Mogas. When did they get so MEAN!?

	PLAYER		Nova said it had something to do with the earthquakes.

	LYLE		Who's Nova? Oh, was that the hot girl? I'd tell you to put in a good word for me, but I've already got a lady. Oh, speaking of which... can you help me out again?

	PLAYER		What do you need?

	LYLE		I was trying to get to Windhym to deliver this care package to Gertrude, my super-hot long distance girlfriend who loves me, but the Mogas out here keep beating on me.

	LYLE		D'you think you could bring the package to her? Pretty please? I swear, I'll do anything. This is my big chance, buddy, and I can't blow it. Please? I'll even clean up my yard!

	DISHES

	PLAYER		OK, I'll bring the package to Windhym.

	LYLE		Heck yeah! Thanks, pal! You're the best neighb-- AAAAUUUGH! Here comes another one! I'm outta here! {ACCEPT}
	
	LYLE OUT
