[STORY]

KELECKA		One of those Woolves that have been running around bit my niece. She got some kind of infection from the bite. I know a remedy that might work, but I'll need some wrathberries.
 
BERRIES
 
KELECKA		Please, can you get them while I stay with? You can find them near here at {$GREEN Bushfall}. {ACCEPT}

KELECKA OUT
