[STORY]
		
	JACKFROST		Hmm? Are you lost? Wouldn't you rather be inside, where it's warm and dry?
	
	PLAYER			Huh? Who are you?
	
	JACKFROST		I'm Jack Frost, of course! I've come to bring winter to the land... have I failed? Is my chill not bitter enough to keep you by the hearth?
	
	PLAYER			It's definitely cold, but I can't go home now-- I'm trying to become a Moga Ranger.
	
	JACKFROST		Oh? Then this might interest you: as I spread my frost into the deep woods, rare Mogas emerge. They're seldom glimpsed, and even more seldom tamed.
	
	JACKFROST		Only the best tamers can catch them, but if my blustery weather can't beat you, maybe you have a chance. What do you say?
	
	PLAYER			I'd be happy to try.
	
	JACKFROST		Excellent! Let me tell you about a strange little friend of mine: Coldbear
	
	COLDBEAR
	
	JACKFROST		Coldbear is a lonely little fellow-- he hibernates in the spring and wakes in the winter.
	
	JACKFROST		While the other bears are sound asleep, he's licking up the frozen dew just like his warm-blooded brothers eat berries-- their paths never cross.
	
	JACKFROST		Perhaps you could tame my poor little Coldbear. He could use a friend!
	
	PLAYER			I'll look for him! {OK}
	
	JACKFROST OUT
