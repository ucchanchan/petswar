[STORY]

CRAIG IN

CRAIG			'Ello there, tamer! Wonderful variety o' Mogas in these woods, eh? The place is just crawling with 'em! 

CRAIG			I don't mean just the common Mogas, either--though sometimes they're the most marvelous of them all. Like Beefee--I've seen one go 'ead to 'ead with an alligator and turn 'im into boots! Wow! 

CRAIG			There are oodles of rare Mogas all around us, but you gotta know where--and how--to look. Lucky for you, I'm a super friendly guy who loves to share his knowledge!

CRAIG			If you have a {$GOLD Gemini} on your team and go to {$GREEN some place}, you'll improve your odds of seeing {$RED Moga}. It might take a couple tries--even under the best circumstances, those rascals are a sly bunch! Wow! {ACCEPT}

CRAIG OUT
