[STORY]
		
	NOVA		This is crazy! I've never seen wild Mogas act so agitated-- I have a feeling the earthquake stirred up something big. You won't get far out there unless you become a Moga Ranger.
	
	NOVA		A Ranger is a serious tamer who builds a large team of Mogas and uses the power of the zodiac for the greater good.
	
	NOVA		Very few tamers have what it takes. But you've captured some Mogas already, and that usually takes months for a new tamer... you're a natural!

	NOVA		The first step is building up your team. You can bring three Mogas into battle at a time, but you can keep as many as you want at home, so you can put together just the right team for any fight.

	NOVA		Back in the last area, you'll find a Moga called Beefee. He's a wily little fella, and he'd make a great addition to your team. Try to capture him.
	
	NOVA		Remember: don't just defeat Beefee. Use a Star Seed to tame him! {OK}
