[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA     Good to see you, tamer! Looks like the Cat Taxi gave you a smooth ride over Poseidon's Gorge.

PLAYER    I'm afraid Bruno might have tried to raft over here. Have you seen him?

NOVA    Not yet--but if he got spat out of the cave, the current would have washed him down this guy named {$GREEN Otto's House}. If I were you, I'd look for him there.

NOVA    Be careful, tamer. You're a long way from home. It's dangerous out here, even for me. {ACCEPT}
