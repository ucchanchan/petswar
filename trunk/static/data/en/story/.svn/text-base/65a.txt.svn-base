[STORY]

VICTORIA IN

VICTORIA    It's you! You won't beat me this time, jerk!

PLAYER        I'm not here to fight...

VICTORIA    Then get outta here! Colibri and I were in the middle of a tea party.

PLAYER        I need your help, Victoria. I'm looking for a special Moga called a Celestial Gatekeeper.

VICTORIA    You mean the sparkly one? I saw it!

VICTORIA    But I'm NOT telling where! I'm gonna tame it, then you'll be sorry! I'm gonna take over the world and use you as a footstool!

PLAYER        Please, Victoria, it's very important that I find it.

VICTORIA    I'm the best tamer! There can be only me! Eat bad death! {OK}

VICTORIA OUT
