[STORY]

SERENE IN

PLAYER		I'm sorry, I couldn't find him. 

SERENE		Oh, that's ok. It turns out he was in the bathroom. My mistake!

PLAYER		Oh, ok. As long as he's safe. 

SERENE		I wish someone would get rid of that darn lobster tornao. It's a real public nuisance, but everyone who's gotten to the bottom of it has gone made, raving about a giant star-covered crab.

PLAYER		Really? That sounds like a Celestial Gatekeeper. 

SERENE		Don't fight it! You'll go crazy!

PLAYER		That's a risk I'll have to take.

SERENE		At least do some mental training. There's this guy Poe--I've some of his poems in "Night Terrors." Just completely insane stuff. I bet talking to him will toughen you up.

PLAYER		I know Poe. He likes your poems, too. I think he's moving to Pueblonia. 

SERENE		Really?! Awesome! Wait, you know Poe? I guess you're cooler than I thought. If you bring a {$GOLD Pisces} team into the {$GREEN Lobster Tornado} you should see the crab. Good luck! {ACCEPT}

SERENE OUT
