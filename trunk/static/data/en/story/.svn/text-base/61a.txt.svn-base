[STORY]

POE IN

POE			I am plunged in darkness. Flames of anguish light the way. I stumble in pain unending, lost.

PLAYER		Hey, Poe. Having a bad day?

POE			No, unfortunately. I'm having a great day. I even found a snake skeleton in the woods, and that's one of my favorite things! 

POE			I was trying to write him a poem when you arrived, but...I'm faking it. My soul isn't really in anguish.

PLAYER		I came to ask a favor: would you be willing to tutor a prince? He needs help getting into poetry.

POE			Normally, I would leap at this opportunity like it was the abyss infernal. But I'm afraid I've lost my inspiration. I might as well change into khakis and a golf shirt--my muse is gone.

PLAYER		You don't happen to know anything about Celestial Gatekeepers, do you?

POE			I feel like I once did, but the hope and joy infecting my brain makes it hard to think.

POE			I need something super dark and grim to get me back to my old self. Like a maggot pie, or a bunch of cow skulls with vines growing over them. 

POE			Or you know what would do it--I've heard of this pit called {$GREEN Rankwallow}. Could you get a bunch of {$BLUE goop} from there? I feel like that might do the trick. {ACCEPT}

#anim of goop, which you will have to get five of from rankwallow
