[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA		Good work with Lambo. Next, you should look for {$RED Dinho}. He's got a fierce kick, but you should be able to tame him without too much trouble.

DINHO

NOVA		Taming more Mogas will make your team more flexible. It'll be easier to beat tough enemies down the road if you can put together a team with more effective zodiac attacks!

NOVA		Dinho shares the road with Lambo at {$GREEN West Summer Road}. {ACCEPT}

NOVA OUT
