[STORY]

SKYLAR IN


SKYLAR        Don't be too proud of yourself. Those were my wimpiest Mogas. I thought that would make it a fair fight--you know, since you're the wimpiest tamer.
  
SKYLAR        Look, past this bridge is Windhym. I heard the mayor there is looking for a tamer for some dangerous mission. Naturally, I'll be volunteering.

SKYLAR        You really should scamper on home before you get hurt. I certainly wouldn't respect you any less. Later on, loser! HRRORORO!

PLAYER        Argh, Skylar...

PLAYER        He's the worst guy. {OK}
    
SKYLAR OUT
