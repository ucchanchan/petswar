[STORY]

PIERCE    Fancy meetin' you here. You find that lost friend of yours yet?

PLAYER    I did. He's just fine--wait, how did you know about Bruno?

PIERCE    Oh, I've been keeping an eye on you. Watching your back just in case you get in a pickle. 

PIERCE		So, what do you say? Ready for some work?

PLAYER    Well, I'm supposed to be heading to Cortex...

PIERCE    Perfect. Same direction. There's a revolting black pit up north of here called {$GREEN Rankwallow}. You can't miss it.

PIERCE    There's a critter living in those ugly depths called {$RED Shen}. Real nasty piece of work. We need it outta there so we can reopen the road.

SHEN

PIERCE    You should try to capture it rather just than beating it down. No sense letting a creature that valuable go to waste.

PIERCE    Yup. It'll be tough, but you can handle it. Head up to {$GREEN Rankwallow} and capture {$RED Shen}. {ACCEPT}
