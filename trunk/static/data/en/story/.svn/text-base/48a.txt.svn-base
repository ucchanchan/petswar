[STORY]

RIP IN

RIP		Listen, o dude, to my tale of woe: once every generation, the White Wave rises from the sea to wreak havoc on all the unwise bros who dare to surf it!

WHITE_WAVE		# anim Terrifying White Wave

RIP		I hail from a long line of Moga Surfers--we tame Mogas and ride their backs through the waves. But time and again, the White Wave has wiped us out.

RIP		My grandfather tried to tame it, but it took him in its foaming jaws and shook him like a rag doll. He never surfed again, dude.

GFATHER_SURFING		# anim Grandfather in striped bathing costume riding a ridiculous giraffe Moga

RIP		Same with my father-- he thought he could ride the White Wave, but it grated him across the reef like cheese. He, too, gave up surfing.

FATHER_SURFING		# anim Father riding a tiny kitten Moga

RIP		But hear this, dude: I shall succeed where my forebros failed. I will ride the White Wave. Oh yes, dude; it shall be so.

PLAYER		Is there any way I can help?

RIP		I've got to find the perfect Surf-Moga. Horus here is fine on the smaller breaks, but I'll need a bigger board to attempt the White Wave.

RIP		Some huge {$RED Hammerdogs} live nearby, but they hardly ever come out. But they love {$RED Chamepo}-- if you capture one first, the scent will let you attract a Hammerdog.

RIP		Dude, could you go over to {$GREEN Talonsweep Point} and capture a {$RED Chamepo} for me? I'd be stoked beyond words.

PLAYER		I'll see what I can do. {ACCEPT}

RIP OUT
