[STORY]

BLACK_OPS IN

BLACK_OPS		Howdy do, tamer. Care to fish a spell?	I tell ya, nothing helps me forget the past like fishin'. 

BLACK_OPS		Yup, nothing helps me forget the bloody things we did in the service like reeling in a fish, cutting off its head, pulling out its guts and cookin' it up with some fresh basil. 

BLACK_OPS		Wanna try it? We lower our Mogas down, let em' duke it out and reel in the reward. {ACCEPT}

BLACK_OPS OUT
