[STORY]

SHEEP_GUY IN

SHEEP_GUY		Hey, tamer, you got a second? I'm hearing some wild rumors and I'd like you to settle the matter.

SHEEP_GUY		My herd's saying there are a bunch of Woolves hanging out at Spiral Cave. I don't want to be disrespectful about it, but I'm pretty sure they're wrong. We've been arguing for days.

SHEEP_GUY		Think you could settle it for us? I know Woolves are usually pretty rare--thank goodness--so if my herd's right you might be able to pick up some useful Mogas for your team. {ACCEPT}

SHEEP_GUY OUT
