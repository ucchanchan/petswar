[STORY]

CRAIG IN

CRAIG			You caught one! What an amazing creature. Let me get my finger in 'ere...look at those teeth! Sharp, eh? 

CRAIG			Wowzers! He's trying to bite me! That's a natural reflex--he's just protecting himself. I'll let 'im go now...easy there, big fella. 

CRAIG			Beautiful specimen. Come by my island if you want more tips on finding rare Mogas. {OK}

CRAIG OUT
