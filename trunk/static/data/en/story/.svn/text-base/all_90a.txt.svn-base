[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA		I'm proud of you, tamer--you've captured every type of Moga near your village. Time to move on to bigger game. 

NOVA		Your next challenge: capture a Muninn. You'll find them several places in the forest, but especially at {$GREEN Shadowmire Edge} and {$GREEN Mourningwood Pass}. 

MUNINN

NOVA		Muninn is an {$GOLD Aquarius} so bringing a {$GOLD Gemini} like Wasabee or Huey will give you an edge. {ACCEPT}
