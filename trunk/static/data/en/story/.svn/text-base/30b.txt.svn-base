[STORY]
		
	JACKFROST		Wonderful! You've tamed Coldbear! And quite easily, too -- maybe, deep down, the poor, lonely thing wanted to be tamed.
	
	JACKFROST		But winter's other child won't be captured so willingly. In fact, you'll be lucky to even find the Lainedeer.
	
	LAINEDEER
	
	JACKFROST		Within days, the ice will thaw and Lainedeer will be gone forever -- can you tame one before then?
	
	JACKFROST		I encourage you to try. Any tamer with a Lainedeer in their menagerie would be a powerful force indeed.
	
	PLAYER			I'll look for the Lainedeer.
	
	JACKFROST		Please do-- good luck! {OK}
	
	JACKFROST OUT
