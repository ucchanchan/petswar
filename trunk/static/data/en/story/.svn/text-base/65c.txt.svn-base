VICTORIA IN

VICTORIA    Aww, gosh dang it! How did you beat me? That's stupid! I hate it!

VICTORIA    I guess maybe your Mogas just like you better... all these tea parties and snuggle naps for nothing!

VICTORIA    Fine... maybe I'm not the best tamer. I guess I gotta tell you where the sparkly Moga is now, huh?

VICTORIA    I've seen it at {$GREEN Windhym Gardens} a few times, but only when I went there with just {$GOLD Scorpio} Mogas on my team...

VICTORIA    Now get outta here! Time to whip these dang lazy Mogas into shape. {ACCEPT}

VICTORIA OUT
