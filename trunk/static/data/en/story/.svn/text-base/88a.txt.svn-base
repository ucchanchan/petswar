[STORY]

POE IN

POE			Oh, hello tamer. Want to hear a poem I'm working on? It uses lasagna as a symbol for life. I'm calling it "Layers of Pasta, Layers of Pain: an Ode in Twelve Parts and a Meat Sauce."

POE			No? OK, maybe another time. Hey, while you're up here, I noticed a lot more {$RED Yugure} at {$GREEN Thornwood} than usual. I'd catch one if I were you--they're usually quite scarce. Like happiness. {OK}

POE OUT
