[STORY]

	LEONARD		Welcome to Windhym, the city of natural harmony.  Where do you hail from?

	PLAYER		I came from Sunshire.

	LEONARD		My word, that's an impressive journey.  Your skill as a tamer must be formidable!

	LEONARD		The mayor is giving a speech about the earthquakes. You should head over-- you Moga tamers might be Windhym's only hope! {ACCEPT}

	LEONARD OUT
