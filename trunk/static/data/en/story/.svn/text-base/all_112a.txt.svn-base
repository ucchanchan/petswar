[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA		The Trolo is one of the terrors of the forest. Less honorable tamers just destroy them for sport or to harvest their horns, but it's better training to capture one.

TROLO

NOVA		Looks pretty nasty, huh? Beefee might help you out--he's a {$GOLD Taurus}, the strongest sign against {$GOLD Capricorns} like the Trolo. A forest lover, you'll find them at {$GREEN Oakford Shade} and {$GREEN Darkwood Vault}. {ACCEPT}
