[STORY]
		
	NOVA		You survived!  I knew you could do it.  You're well on your way to becoming a Moga Master.
	
	NOVA		Your Mogas are strong enough to help others now.  Speaking of which, when I was chasing the dragon, I passed someone who looked like he could use some help.
	
	NOVA		He was camped to the north of here. Some kind of military official, I think. You might want to see if he needs anything.

	PLAYER		I'll try to find him.
	
	NOVA		I'm going to head toward Windhym and make sure everything's OK there. I'll meet up with you soon. {OK}
	
	NOVA OUT
