[STORY]

JEZABELLE IN

JEZABELLE			Well if it isn't the bumpkin from Windhym! You must've wised up a little if you're still walking.

PLAYER				I'm looking for the Celestial Gatekeepers--they're special Mogas covered in stars. Have you seen any in the desert?

JEZABELLE			Hmmm...maybe I have, maybe I haven't. If I knew about something you wanted, why would I give it to you for free?

PLAYER				For one thing, this world is going to be torn apart if I don't find the Gatekeepers. But I'm also willing to do you a favor.

JEZABELLE			Now you're talking my language. Tell you what, tamer--this desert life is starting to wear on me. Sand in my shoes. Sand in my hair. Sand in my sandwiches. Sounds cute, but it isn't.

JEZABELLE			I'm looking to get back into city life. If you can grease the wheels for my return to Pueblonia, maybe I could tell how to find a Scorpio Gatekeeper I've seen. 

PLAYER				I'll see what I can do. {ACCEPT} #tobi tells you to go to pueblonia
