[STORY]

OTTO IN

OTTO		Oh, does this thing belong to you? Poor little fella washed ashore a little while back. He's been out cold the whole time, sorry to say.

PLAYER		Is there any way I can revive him?

OTTO		You can probably jump-start his guts with a shock from an {$RED Electrotter}. 

ELECTROTTER

OTTO		It's pretty dangerous, but heck, I do it all the time. Feels tingly.

OTTO		Head over to {$GREEN Electrotter Sound} to find one. Beat one of them and I bet we can get this little guy's motor running again. 

OTTO		Oh, but a word of warning: watch out for that big lobstery guy, Sandman! He attacks me whenever I leave the dam. {ACCEPT}

OTTO OUT
