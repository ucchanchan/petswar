PLAYER		I'm looking for the Celestial Gatekeepers and heard you might be able to help me. 

KELECKA		Most definitely! I've seen the Moga you're looking for but I think it's moved on. A creature that size is hard to miss--and I haven't seen it in weeks.

KELECKA		It probably went south with the current. If you know anyone else down that way who spends a lot of time on the water, I'd ask them. {ACCEPT} #tobi says talk to sandman
