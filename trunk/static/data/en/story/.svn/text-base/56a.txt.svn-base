[STORY]

PIERCE IN


PIERCE    Ah, you made it. Good to see you. Friend, I've got some things to discuss with you.

PIERCE    We're living in strange times. Earthquakes, Mogas going apehockey. In times like these, folks need to feel safe. My company provides that safety.

PIERCE    I reckon I never told you who I work for, did I? It's a firm called Steel Peaks. We used to deal primarily in private security.  Bigwigs with reckless daughters, fancy folks with too much money--you know the type.

PIERCE    But nowadays, everyone needs our services. People are scared. They don't know what to do. They give us a pile of money and we keep the boogeyman away.

PIERCE		We're making money hand-over-fist, friend! When an opportunity like this comes knocking, you don't tell it you're busy baking cookies--you tell it to come in!

PIERCE		I think you've got the skills to be a part of this operation. It's not our fault things have gone so wrong, so why not make a few bucks?

PIERCE		How's about you meet up with me at Steel Peaks and we'll talk about getting you on board? 

PIERCE		Sh--don't decide right now. Think about it. All the money and Mogas you want for as long as this trouble keeps up. Not a bad deal, friend. {OK}
