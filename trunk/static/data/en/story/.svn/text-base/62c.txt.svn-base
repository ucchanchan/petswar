[STORY]

SERENE IN

SERENE		Without that crazy crab's energy holding the lobster tornado together, the whole thing is coming apart! Run!

#anim of lobster tornado coming apart

SERENE		Thanks for getting rid of that thing. I'm sure the lobsters will also be much happier swimming in the ocean than flying through the air.

POE IN

POE			Hello? Are you "Wingless Angel"? I heard you live up here.

SERENE		YES!  Are you Poe? 

POE			In the pale, mortal flesh. Do you want to get a cup of coffee, eat some lobster and talk about death?

SERENE		YES! Oh, and my real name is Serene.

PLAYER		I'll leave you two to get acquainted. Do you have any idea where I might find another Celestial Guardian?

SERENE		The deserts south of here have many mysteries. Look around there. #Tobi will tell you where to look 

SERENE		Come on, Poe, I know where the biggest cow skull you've ever seen is. Sometimes there are even worms crawling through the eye holes!

POE				Awesome! Thanks, Ranger--you've made me the most miserable man alive.

SERENE OUT

POE OUT
