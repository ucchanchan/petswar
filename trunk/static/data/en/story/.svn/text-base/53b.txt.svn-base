[STORY]

SCIENTISTS IN

SCIENTISTS		These look delicious! Actually...they look kind of like...well, never mind, anything other than canned beans is great. You want to hear about the dragon, right? 

SCIENTISTS		We don't know how big it is, but it must be huge--maybe bigger than Cortex. Since it left these piles here, there must be some passage from the surface to its underground home. We can't seem to find it, though.

SCIENTISTS		If you're trying to reach the dragon, you're going to have to find its entrance or some way to dig deep down. Or someone who's already started digging.

SCIENTISTS		Wish we could tell you more, but that's about it. Big dragon, deep in the planet, no obvious way to reach it. Thanks for the candy! {OK}
