[STORY]

	BRUNO		Whoa! Nice Mogas you got there!

	BRUNO		So when were you planning on telling me that you'd become a tamer? Some 'best friend' you are.

	PLAYER		Hey, Bruno! Sorry I didn't tell you... it all happened pretty suddenly.

	BRUNO		No worries, I was just messing with you. So are you here to help the mayor? I heard he was looking for tamers, and you've always been the do-gooder type.

	PLAYER		I'm trying to make my way to Cortex.

	BRUNO		Cortex? That's a rough trip, pal. Maybe you should grab some tougher Mogas first.

	BRUNO		There's a really fierce one that lives on Southshire Bridge, up ahead. I almost caught it, but it's just too tough. You should try!

	BRUNO		It's a big octopus-lookin' thing called Paul. I have to warn you, pal: Paul doesn't mess around.

	PLAYER		I'll see if I can catch him. {ACCEPT}

	BRUNO OUT
