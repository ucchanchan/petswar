[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA		There's an odd cat at {$GREEN East Summer Road} and {$GREEN Darkwood Vault} known as the Alyx. Sadly, some unscrupulous tamers have hunted Alyxes for their lustrous fur coats, making them very suspicious of intruders. 

NOVA		You don't want to just beat it, though--you want to capture the Alyx. Once an Alyx accepts you as its tamer, it will be loyal to you forever. 

ALYX

NOVA		 Being a Moga tamer is a great responsibility, so take good care of your Alyx when you catch it! {ACCEPT}
