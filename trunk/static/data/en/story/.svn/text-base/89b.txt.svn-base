[STORY]

SHEEP_GUY IN

SHEEP_GUY		So there are a bunch of Woolves down there? Oh man, what a bust! I told Grover that if he was right I'd eat grass for a week. And I really like eating oats instead.

SHEEP_GUY		Oh well, I guess it's nothing but greens for me! That Grover--what a rascal. One of these days I'll outsmart him. {OK}

SHEEP_GUY OUT
