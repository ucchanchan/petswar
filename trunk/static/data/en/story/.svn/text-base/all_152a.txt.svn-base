[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA		Colibri is a beautiful, deadly bird. The hunt for this creature has been the downfall of many tamers, but I'm sure you'll do fine.

COLIBRI

NOVA		Their sharp beaks let them suck nectar from giant flowers and pierce the hearts of predators--but you've got an advantage.

NOVA		That Alyx you captured a little while ago? It's a {$GOLD Leo}, a zodiac sign very strong against a {$GOLD Libra} like Colibri. Look at {$GREEN Miasma Depths}. {ACCEPT}

NOVA OUT
