[STORY]

PIERRE IN

KAREEM IN

PIERRE    You've got it! You've got a MOGANAME! Gimme! Now!

KAREEM     Manners, Pierre.

PIERRE    Give it to me now, please! Now!

YOU        Here you go, Pierre. Take care of it.

PIERRE    C'mere, little guy! Grovel before your new master!

PIERRE    ...Hey, what gives? It's not coming over here!

KAREEM ABDUL    I think you know why, Pierre. This Moga has bonded with our friend now. It can't just be given away.

PIERRE    Aww, butts! That's stupid! Now I'll NEVER tell you where the Taurus Gatekeeper is.

KAREEM     Pierre, I think our friend has given you something of great value: a lesson about the loyalty of Mogas. Now it's time to return the favor.

PIERRE        Argh! I hate being good! This is so dumb! OK, fine. FINE! The Taurus Gatekeeper usually hangs out at {$GREEN Saltspawn Pool}.

PIERRE        But you'll never, ever see it unless you've got an all {$GOLD Capricorn} team! 

YOU        Thank you so much, Pierre. You're going to be a great ruler one day.

PIERRE        Shut up! 

PIERRE OUT

KAREEM			Can I talk to you in private for a minute? Pierre would be very embarrassed if he knew I was talking to you about this.

KAREEM			My young ward has been struggling with his studies. Classical Pueblonian poetry in particular is giving him a hard time, and I'm more than a little worried. 

KAREEM			You see, poetry is one of the cornerstones of a royal Pueblonian royal education. The ability to imagine, to understand, to feel deeply--these are things the great kings and queens of Puebonia learned from our poetic tradition.

KAREEM			I know you have traveled far and met many people. Do you know anyone devoted to the art of poetry--someone almost painfully aware of his feelings--who could tutor Pierre? 

PLAYER			I think I know just the guy...  #Tobi says go to Poe

KAREEM			Thank you very much, tamer. The city of Pueblonia is in your debt. {ACCEPT}

KAREEM OUT
