[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA        That's the last of the Moga Master taming sequence! Amazing work--you're part of an elite group now, and you'll be able to tame Mogas that few others can.

NOVA			{$RED Black Gold} is a massive dragon that simply doesn't appear for lesser tamers. It's part of an ancient breed of Mogas that defies human understanding--but now you'll be able to capture one.

BLACK_GOLD

NOVA        Go to the {$GREEN Lobster Tornado}; there will be a {$RED Black Gold} waiting to test you in battle. {ACCEPT}


NOVA OUT
