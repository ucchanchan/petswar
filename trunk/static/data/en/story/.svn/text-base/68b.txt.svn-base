ROSIE        Oh! It's the little neighbor! My, you've grown up so very fine and wonderful!

PLAYER        Thank you. Uh, I'm actually here about Skylar...

ROSIE        My precious little muffin! He's over in Cortex, being a big, grown-up tamer, but he'll always be my fancy little man.

PLAYER        I need some help from him, but he refuses to talk to me. What should I do?

ROSIE        You must be mistaken! That doesn't sound like the polite little boy I raised. Are you heading back to Cortex any time soon?

PLAYER        I'm sure I'll be back that way.

ROSIE        Oh, how lovely! Can you do me a favor? My little muffin-prince left home without his prescription safety underpants!

PLAYER         His what?

[image - prescription underpants]

ROSIE        He'll get so chafed and grumpy without them! Would you please bring them to him? He'll be so happy!

ROSIE        Oh, and tell him that his mother DEMANDS that he help you! He's the most powerful tamer in the world, and he should use his might for good!

PLAYER        Thanks! {ACCEPT}
