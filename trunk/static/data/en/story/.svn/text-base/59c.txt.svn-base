CRAIG IN

CRAIG		Congratulations, tamer, that's quite a catch! Lovely creature!

CRAIG		That's the only Gatekeeper I know of--they're really hard to find! You might ask Pierre, the sultan of Pueblonia, at the {$GREEN Royal Battledome}. He's kind of a brat but he does know his Mogas! {ACCEPT}

CRAIG OUT
