[STORY]

CRAIG IN

CRAIG		Have you ever seen a Balled Watersquirrel? Fantastic creatures! Once a year they all gather in the south seas to mate and play water polo. Quite a sight! 

CRAIG		The water polo gets broken up by the other stuff, but they're great sports about it! Truly a once in a lifetime sight--I'm going over to {$GREEN Sanctuary Isle} to watch it right now!

PLAYER		Do you know anything about the Celestial Gatekeepers? I'm trying to catch them.

CRAIG		Oh, wowzers, now there's a rare beast! Marvelous creatures, eh! I'd love to chat, but I have to leave right now to catch the Watersquirrels.

		# give this info to Tobi: Meet Craig at {$GREEN Sanctuary Isle} to find out what he knows. {ACCEPT}

CRAIG OUT
