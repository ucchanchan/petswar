[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA			I saw what happened back at Cortex. Tough break. 

YOU				Does it matter? Even if Skylar hadn't beaten me there, Cortex doesn't have a way to stop the earthquakes.

NOVA			To be honest, I never thought they'd be able to. They're dealing with forces more powerful than all their science. They told you about the world dragon, right?

YOU				Yeah. They said there's no way to stop it.

NOVA			No way for THEM to stop it. I don't think I could, either. But you-- at the rate your powers have grown since we met, you may be our best hope.

NOVA			There's a legendary string of islands that appears to heroic tamers in times of disaster. It's called the Zodiac Islands--if there's any way to defeat the dragon, you'll find it there.
 
NOVA			These aren't any normal islands, though. They'll only appear once you've captured the twelve {$RED Celestial Gatekeepers}. If you catch them all, you'll know that the zodiac has chosen you.

NOVA			I tried to find them years ago, back when I thought I was pretty hot stuff. I could only find one; it was in the {$GREEN Cerulean Pool}--take a {$GOLD Leo} team there and you should be able to draw it out.
 
NOVA 			To find the rest of the Celestial Gatekeepers, talk to the people you've helped. Try Craig Sherman at {$ GREEN Adventure Island}--he's a master of rare Mogas.
