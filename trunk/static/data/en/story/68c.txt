SKYLAR        You again!? I thought I told you to beat it!

PLAYER        I've got a little present from your mom. She asked me to bring you your prescrip--

SKYLAR        No! I don't want them! I'm a grown-up now! I can wear big boy underpants! Take them away!

PLAYER        Well, I promised your mother. If you won't take them, I'll just have to talk to Lyla and officially check them through Cortex customs.

SKYLAR        No! You sneaky little... argh! Fine! I'll tell you where the Gemini Gatekeeper is if you destroy those things.

PLAYER        Deal. Tell me where to find it.

SKYLAR        Pff. If you were a REAL tamer, you would have seen it already. It hangs out in our neighborhood, by {$GREEN East Summer Road}.

SKYLAR        I could have tamed it any time I wanted, but I didn't want to. Just go there with a {$GOLD Libra} team, and you'll see it sooner or later.

SKYLAR        Now get out of my sight, loser! I've got a city to protect! {ACCEPT}

SKYLAR OUT
