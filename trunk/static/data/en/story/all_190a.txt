[STORY]

NOVA IN

NOVA		Alright, that's enough forest Mogas for now. There are more creatures in there, but they're harder to find--and you've got bigger game to hunt: the Nar.

NOVA		They're insane, giant insectoids that prefer to eat their prey while it's still living. 

NOVA		 You can find them at {$GREEN Swirly Cave} and {$GREEN Megahole}. You won't meet too many tamers with a Nar; you'll stand out with one of these on your team. {ACCEPT}

NOVA OUT
