[STORY]
LYLE IN

LYLE	Uuuuuggghhh... I feel terrible, man. My uncle Norman came by and gave me some mushrooms he picked, but I don't think they were the kind you can eat. Uncle Norman's eyes aren't so good, you know.
 
LYLE	Don't get me wrong, they were delicious. But now I feel like I'm floating in a tin can high above the night sky, and it's making it kind of hard to do normal stuff.
 
LYLE	Norman told me that if this happens, there's an herbal tea that would get my head right. All I need are some Bluebottom flowers to make it. I think there's a patch over at {$GREEN Oakford Shade}.
 
FLOWERS

LYLE	It woulod be awesome if you could get those. Until you get back, I'll just be wandering around in the woods. {ACCEPT}

LYLE OUT
