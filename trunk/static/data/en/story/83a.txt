[STORY]

PIERCE IN

PIERCE        Whoah, whoah--hold up there, shortpants. These woods are mighty dangerous and it's my job to see that no one gets hurt. I'm afraid I can't let you through.

PIERCE        You really want to get past, huh? Alright--if you know so much about Mogas, how about a team battle? If you can beat all of my guys in a tamer fight, I'll trust you can handle yourself. {ACCEPT}

PIERCE OUT
