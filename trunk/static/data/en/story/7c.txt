[STORY]

	POE		Oh, great. You think I'm weird now, don't you?
	
	PLAYER		Uhh...

	POE		Those accusing eyes of yours! I know she's not exactly a normal, living girl... but I can't help it! My heart is a dark wild raven that cannot be caged! I love her!

	POE		Ah, that's Lenore's key! You see? She must have been so grateful that you delivered my letters that she allowed you to take that as a gift! My wraith, my ghostly beloved, I knew you loved me!

	PLAYER		What does this key open?
	
	POE		Oh... I think it opens the gate to that old castle. If you go, be cautious... No soul has passed those gates since the dark ages... {ACCEPT}

	POE OUT
