[STORY]

PIERCE IN

PIERCE        Impressive! I thought I knew all the tamers in this region, but you're a pleasant surprise. A real up-and-comer.

PIERCE        Keeping these woods safe is a big job. Talk to me later and I might have some work for you--and you better believe ol' Sergeant Pierce pays well. {OK}

PIERCE OUT
