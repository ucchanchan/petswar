[STORY]

PIERRE IN

KAREEM IN

PIERRE    You've got it! You've got a MOGANAME! Gimme! Now!

KAREEM     Manners, Pierre.

PIERRE    Give it to me now, please! Now!

YOU        Here you go, Pierre. Take care of it.

PIERRE    C'mere, little guy! Grovel before your new master!

PIERRE    ...Hey, what gives? It's not coming over here!

KAREEM     I think you know why, Pierre. This Moga has bonded with our friend now. He can't just give it away.

PIERRE    Aww, butts! That's stupid! Now I'll NEVER tell you where the Taurus Guardian is.

PLAYER        Pierre, it's very, very important that I find it.

KAREEM     Pierre, I think our friend has given you something of great value: a lesson about the loyalty of Mogas. You owe him something in return.

PIERRE        Argh! I hate being good! This is so dumb! OK, fine. FINE! The Taurus Guardian usually hangs out in NODE NAME.

PIERRE        But you'll never, ever see it unless you've got an all-Taurus team! It only comes out when it smells its own kind.

PLAYER        Thank you so much, Pierre. You're going to be a great ruler one day.

PIERRE        Shut up! 

PIERRE OUT

KAREEM			Can I talk to you in private for a minute? Pierre would be very embarrassed if he knew I was talking to you about this.

KAREEM			My young ward has been struggling with his studies. Classical Pueblonian poetry in particular is giving him a hard time, and I'm more than a little worried. 

KAREEM			Poetry has always been one of the cornerstones of Pueblonia's royal education. The ability to imagine, to understand, to feel deeply--these are things the great kings and queens of Puebonia learned from our poetic tradition.

KAREEM			I know you have traveled far and met many people. Do you know anyone devoted to the art of poetry--someone almost painfully aware of his feelings--who could tutor Pierre? 

PLAYER			I think I know just the guy...  #Tobi says go to Poe

KAREEM			Thank you very much, tamer. The city of Pueblonia is in your debt. {ACCEPT}

KAREEM OUT
