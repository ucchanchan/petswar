[STORY]

	PIERCE		You made it back, huh? Can't say I expected you to survive down there, to be honest.
	
	PLAYER		What? Really?

	PIERCE		Nah, just ribbin' ya. I knew you could do it.

	PIERCE		Great work, though. If you're still looking for action, you might head to the east and see what the situation is out there. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other around-- I can always use a good tamer. {OK}

	PIERCE OUT
